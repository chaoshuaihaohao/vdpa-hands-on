# Virtio Hands On
Scripts and ansible playbooks for Virtio Hands-On blog series.

The Virtio blog series are split into three threads:

 - **Solution Overview**: Intended for IT experts, it contains a high level overview of a specific architecture
 - **Deep Dive**: Intended for architects, has more technical details of how each component interacts with the rest
 - **Hands On**: Intended for developers, includes the commands needed to set up and play around with each architecture. These scripts aim to help with this task.

Here is a complete index of all the posts that comprise the blog series.

For a high level introduction of what is virtio technology refer to [the introduction blog](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-virtio-networking-combining-virtualization-and-networking-modern-it).

For documentation on virtio and all it's related components and possible architectures, please refer to the correspondent blog post.

The aim of these set of scripts is to make it really straightforward to set up
a number of different virtio environments for testing and debugging purposes

The supported environments are:

- vhost-net
- vhost-user
- TBD


## Requirements
- The scripts assume you're running Fedora30 although they might work on other distros.
- Ansible > 2.6
- The ansible playbook runs locally and requires "sudo" for some tasks. When you run it,
you will be asked for the BECOME password (i.e: your sudo password)

## Vhost-net
In order to set up the vhost-net environment, first you should check the settings file that can be found at `vars/vhost-net_settings.yml`.
Customize any variable you consider necessary (for example, the guest's root password).

Then, run the following command:

```
    $ ansible-playbook vhost-net.yml
```

## Vhost-user
In order to set up the vhost-user environment, first you should check the settings file that can be found at `vars/vhost-user_settings.yml`.
Customize any variable you consider necessary (for example, the guest's root password).

Then, manually modify your kernel's command line parameters to add hugepage support. The following command will add 6 hugepages of size 1G:

```
grubby --args=â€œdefault_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=6" --update-kernel $(grubby --default-kernel)
```

A reboot is needed for the command line options to take effect.

Finaly, run the following command:

```
    $ ansible-playbook vhost-user.yml
```

The ansible script will:

- Set up a virtual machine running Centos 7
- Configure two vhost-user interfaces on it
- Run DPDK's testpmd application on the host. The application is interactive so
it will open inside a tmux session
- Start the guest and configure hugepages on it
- Start DPDK's testpmd application on the guest as well (also inside a tmux session)

After running the playbook you can:
- Inspect the host's testpmd application by running:

```
$ tmux attach-session testpmd-session
```

- Jump into the guest by running:

```
$ export LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI="qemu:///system"; virsh command vhuser-test1
```

- Inspect the guest's testpmd application by running:

```
$ tmux attach-session -t guest-testpmd-session
```
